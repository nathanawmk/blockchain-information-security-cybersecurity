# blockchain-information-security-cybersecurity
This paper explores the intersection of blockchain and information security/cyber-security. It explains how blockchain can help enable and achieve the CIA Triad - Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability - with its unique attributes. i.e., cryptographically based data structure (integrity), consensus mechanism (integrity) and decentralized architecture (availability). Confidentiality could be achieved zero knowledge proofs (ZKP)
